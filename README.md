# Tic Tac Toe

A Tic Tac Toe game built with Vue 3, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Motion.  
The player is **X** and plays against an AI **O**, infused by a minimax algorithm.  
X and O are rendered as animated SVGs with Motion (yes copy paste SVG's from example on their website).

This game could not be beaten. After receiving much post through my corrugated letterbox, I could not resist the urge to add a human touch to the algorithm. Sometimes the AI fails! Happy faces again.
